      section.page
        section.label There's a clear cycle:
        section.label
          span A couple days of 
          span.netflix Netflix 
          span on top
        section.label
          span Then a few days of "
          span.meme Meme

        section.label
          span And then back to 
          span.netflix Netflix
          span , and so on

          p
            span We watch 
            span.netflix Netflix
            span  on the weekend, and spend our weekdays looking at 
            span.meme memes.
          p
            span This is especially true on the last weekday before a holiday: there are clear spikes in searches for 
            span.meme meme 
            span on the days before Thanksgiving and Christmas.

        section.label
          span But in December, this weekly cycle changed, and

        section.label
          span In return, 
          span.birdbox Bird Box 
          span helped push the number of searches for

        section.label
          span At the peak of its popularity (Dec. 27-29), searches for

          span surpassed searches for  
          span.netflix Netflix

          span Meanwhile, in movie theaters, 
          span.aquaman Aquaman 
          span was also released on December 21: the same day as 
          span.birdbox Bird Box
          span . It led the box office charts for three weeks, and has grossed over 
          a(href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=dcfilm0617.htm") 1 billion dollars worldwide
          span .
        section.label
          span Despite its success in theaters, 
          span.aquaman Aquaman 
          span has averaged only 
          span.strong half 
          span the search volume of

          span since they were released.
        section.label
          span.birdbox Bird Box 
          span probably hasn't grossed a billion dollars for 
          span.netflix Netflix
          span , but the wild success of its 
          span.meme meme
          span -friendly marketing effort probably means we can expect to see many more

          span -driven movies and PR campaigns in the future.
